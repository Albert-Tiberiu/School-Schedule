# School-Schedule
The program shows the current class a student has depending on the time of the system and a given class schedule. It also tells the user what the next class will be and when it will start.
I have used this program in the pandemic period when school classes were held online and the duration of a class was 45 minutes and a break would be 10 minutes, becoming difficult to remember when each class would start and end because all classes would delay with 5 minutes each to the last class.
